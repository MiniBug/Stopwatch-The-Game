Stopwatch-The-Game
=========
based on online self-paced tutorial.

written with pure python no frameworks.

To play the game you must load the code in http://www.codeskulptor.org
and hit "play" button on the top left of the screen.

In future my goal is to make this game standalone executable so it won't depend on web browser interpreter.
